# Introduction

This project marks the beginning of my research journey, which I started after my second semester at Purdue. At the time, my knowledge of machine learning was limited. However, under the guidance of Professor Vhaduri, I gained a lot of valuable experience throughout this project. While I don't consider it groundbreaking, I wanted to share it with you. If you're interested, below is the link to the paper. `train.py` is a code snippet of the training process.
